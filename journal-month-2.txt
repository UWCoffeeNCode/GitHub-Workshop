Premise:
By some clerical error in WaterlooWorks, our protagonist got an offer from a big tech company as a Junior Software Developer. 
They know they are surely under-qualified, but what-the-hey, the proposition for free meals and unlimited snacks meant the offer was accepted anyways!  
They have now been working at this company for 1 month, and they might be starting to get the hang of things.
Write a dayâ€™s entry in their journal, as our protagonist fakes it till they make it!

Day 6:

Dear diary,
Today I pretended to understand what my co-worker was doing. Apparently, it was something called coding.
